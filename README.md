 Functionalities expected from a NFT Marketplace: 1) NFT Contract 2) Marketplace  Contract  
 # Item Listing:
 The smart contract  have a function that allows users (sellers) to list items for sale. This function would take parameters such as item details (name, description, 
 price, etc.) and store this information on the blockchain. 
 # Item Purchasing: 
Another function could enable buyers to purchase items. It would involve transferring cryptocurrency (Ether) from the buyer to the smart contract and updating ownership of the item accordingly. Escrow and Payment: To ensure secure transactions, an escrow mechanism can be implemented. When a buyer purchases an item, the payment is held in the smart contract until the buyer confirms receipt and satisfaction with the item. Then, the funds are released to the seller.
# Ownership Transfer: 
The smart contract should have a function that facilitates the transfer of ownership of the purchased item from the seller to the buyer. This could involve updating the ownership information stored in the contract.
# Cancelling Transactions: 
Both buyers and sellers may need the ability to cancel transactions under certain conditions. Implementing a cancellation function can allow for refunds or releasing funds back to the buyer.
